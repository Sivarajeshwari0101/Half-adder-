# Design and analysis of Half adder using advanced transistor technology
As  the dimensions  of  MOSFET  (Metal Oxide Semiconductor  Field  Effect  Transistor) decreases, the  short  channel  effect  (SCE)  becomes  a  dominating concern  in  VLSI.  The  Short  channel  effect  causes  an exponential increase in the leakage current. To reduce the SCE and hence leakage current, a new technology has been developed in recent years.
# A Glance at the Bandgap Reference IP
This paper presents design and analysis of half adder using Finfet technology. As  the dimensions  of  MOSFET  (Metal Oxide Semiconductor  Field  Effect  Transistor) decreases, the  short  channel  effect  (SCE)  becomes  a  dominating concern  in  VLSI.  The  Short  channel  effect  causes  an exponential increase in the leakage current. To reduce the SCE and hence leakage current, a new technology has been developed in recent years. In this recent technology a 3D multiple  gate  MOSFETs like  FinFET  (Fin  Field  Effect Transistor) has  been  developed. FinFET is the new growing technology that works in the nm range to minimize short channel effects.
